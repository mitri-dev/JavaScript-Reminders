### JavaScript Reminders  
This is a simple app that I though of. I came back to school and found myself looking for some kind of app that would allow me to add my **subjects** and change the color of a **button** so I would remember what to do for each subject.  

## Featues  
- It has **4** different colors to choose from, these colors can have any meaning but here are my interpretation:  
  - **Red**: The subject has Homework to do.    
  - **Blue**: The subject has nothing remarkable to do.     
  - **Green**: The subject's Homework is completed.    
  - **Yellow**: The subject has something to be Reviewed.  
- The colors that you choose are saved in **Local Storage**.  

## Notes:  
In order to add subjects, you must edit the HTML, sometime in the future ill add the feature where you can just add/delete any item form the list, kind of busy right now.
